# My Portfolio Website 
Finding a job and securing an interview with a good resume will always be an important part of a programmer's journey. Without a doubt, a personal portfolio website is one way to demonstrate one's programming ability, as well as to showcase oneself. So here's my personal portfolio website: https://jetstar10.github.io/Portfolio/

This GitHub repository hosts the code for my personal portfolio website. Code template taken from [Shelley Benhoff's GitHub's personal portfolio website template source code](https://github.com/sbenhoff007/portfolio) and developed by [Nisar Hassan](https://github.com/nisarhassan12) (you can find his GitHub by clicking the link) (credits to them :)) and is further built upon for my personal use. This GitHub repository hosting the code for my personal portfolio website is deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can see how this is done from this Youtube video by HoffsTech (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CykufIPK_6o&t=193s).

## Troubleshooting Issues Regarding Deployment with GitHub Pages
Edits to the code might not be reflected on the portfolio website page by regular refreshing of the portfolio website page on your local browser. You may need to wait until the rebuilding of the code is done before doing a hard refresh with the following commands:
```text
Windows/Linux: CTRL + SHIFT + R
Mac: CMD + SHIFT + R
Open in incognito mode to bypass cache.
```
